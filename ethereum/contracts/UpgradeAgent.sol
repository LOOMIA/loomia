/**
 * Upgrade agent interface inspired by Lunyr.
 *
 * Upgrade agent transfers tokens to a new version of a token contract.
 * Upgrade agent can be set on a token by the upgrade master.
 *
 * Steps are
 * - Upgradeabletoken.upgradeMaster calls UpgradeableToken.setUpgradeAgent()
 * - Individual token holders can now call UpgradeableToken.upgrade()
 *   -> This results to call UpgradeAgent.upgradeFrom() that issues new tokens
 *   -> UpgradeableToken.upgrade() reduces the original total supply based on amount of upgraded tokens
 *
 * Upgrade agent itself can be the token contract, or just a middle man contract doing the heavy lifting.
